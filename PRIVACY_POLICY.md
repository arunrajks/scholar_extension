# Privacy Policy - Scholarly: Unified Research Search

**Last Updated: February 7, 2026**

Scholarly ("we", "us", or "our") operates the Scholarly Chrome Extension. Your privacy is important to us.

## 1. Data Collection
The Scholarly extension does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII). 

## 2. Search Queries
When you perform a search using the extension, your query text is sent to our backend server to aggregate search results from various scholarly databases (Crossref, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, CORE, and arXiv). These queries are used solely to fetch results and are not linked to your identity.

## 3. Third-Party APIs
Our backend communicates with third-party scholarly APIs. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for how they handle query data:
- [Crossref Privacy Policy](https://www.crossref.org/privacy/)
- [OpenAlex Privacy Policy](https://openalex.org/terms)
- [Semantic Scholar Privacy Policy](https://www.semanticscholar.org/privacy)

## 4. Permissions
- **activeTab**: Used only to interact with the current tab when you click the extension.
- **Host Permissions**: Necessary to communicate with the scholarly search backend and APIs.

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
